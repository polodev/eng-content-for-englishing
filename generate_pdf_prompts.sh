my template file is \`$TEMPLATE_FILE\`
my pdf is in \`$pdf_file\`

please convert pdf content to text content and make a json file inside \`response-json\` folder with name like pdf. json file should follow template style. exact same as template. as it has only single language. so other locale need to be done: translation, transliteration and native_transliteration
basic about 2 terms: 
- \`*_native_transliteration\`: datatype json with [bn, es, fr, hi] keys. written in respective language. Help non english speakers to know english pronunciation.
- \`*_transliteration\`: datatype string. written in Pure English. Help english speakers know its pronunciation
